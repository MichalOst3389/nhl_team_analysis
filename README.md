Based on the analysis, it seems that the Buffalo Sabres need to improve their defense if they want to become more competitive in the league. The team has a similar number of goals for compared to one of the best teams in the league, the Boston Bruins. However, their number of goals against is also the same, which is a big problem.

To understand why successful teams like Boston allow so many fewer goals than Buffalo, we need to compare the defense for different situations for both teams. By grouping the data by team and situation and getting the sum of goals against, we can see which situations are leading to goals against for each team. Reshaping the data to a wide format and calculating the total goals against for each team can help us calculate the percentage of each situation's goals against out of the team's total goals against. This information can be used to identify areas where Buffalo needs to improve their defense.

The top relevant features for goalsAgainst for Buffalo and Boston were calculated and compared. For Buffalo, it was found that highDangerGoalsAgainst and mediumDangerGoalsAgainst were the top two correlated features to goalsAgainst, indicating that Buffalo was allowing teams to get to these areas too easily. For Boston, it was found that mediumDangerGoalsAgainst and highDangerGoalsAgainst were the top two correlated features, but the highDangerGoalsAgainst for Boston was lower than for Buffalo, which suggests that Boston was doing a better job of keeping shooters out of the high danger areas.

Our current analysis aims to investigate the divergent goal-scoring strategies employed by the Boston and Buffalo teams in high-danger situations. To achieve this, we applied a filter to the situation data, retaining only those instances where high-danger goals were scored against the teams. Subsequently, we grouped the resulting dataframe by team and summed the number of high-danger goals allowed by each team. Our findings reveal that Buffalo has allowed 30 more high-danger goals compared to Boston, which poses a significant challenge for them in games that are closely contested. Despite Buffalo's reputation as a formidable scoring team, addressing their tendency to concede high-danger goals may be crucial to improving their overall performance.

The goal of the linear regression model was to determine the relationship between the position of a shot on the hockey rink (features) and the probability of that shot being a goal (target), which is denoted as 'xGoal'. Specifically, the model aimed to predict the number of goals that would result from shots taken outside the "danger zone" area of the rink. Before running the model, it was observed that the actual number of goals scored in this area was 4499.

The data was split into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function from the 'sklearn.model_selection' module, with 20% of the data being used for testing and the remaining 80% for training the model.

To fit the linear regression model, the 'LinearRegression' class from the 'sklearn.linear_model' module was used to create an instance of the model. The 'fit' method of this instance was then called with the training data to fit the model to the data.

After fitting the model, a lambda function was used with the 'apply' method of the 'pandas' DataFrame to modify the y-coordinate of the shots. This involved adding 5 to non-negative values and subtracting 5 from negative values. The modified data was then used to make predictions using the 'predict' method of the linear regression model, and the predicted values were stored in the 'y_pred' variable.

The number of shots predicted to be goals was calculated by counting the number of predicted values that were greater than or equal to 0.5, which is the cutoff probability for a shot being classified as a goal. In this case, the model predicted that 760 out of 41510 shots (1.8%) would result in goals.

The root mean squared error (RMSE) between the actual target values and the predicted target values was calculated to assess the performance of the model. In this case, the RMSE was 0.0079, which means that, on average, the predicted probabilities of the shots being goals were off by 0.0079 units from the actual probabilities.



Next, our analysis aims to investigate the impact of rebounds on goal scoring and identify which types of shots are most likely to result in rebounds. The correlation analysis suggests that higher values of rebound tend to be associated with higher values of goal, but the strength of this relationship is only moderate (correlation coefficient: 0.295). When looking at the correlation between just Buffalo's goals against and rebounds, there is a stronger correlation suggesting that Buffalo does worse than average at defending against rebounds (correlation coefficient: 0.321).

To provide further insights, a density map was created to visualize the most frequent areas where rebound shots tend to occur. This map can be a valuable tool for goalies and defensemen in anticipating the puck's location and taking proactive measures to prevent the opposing team from scoring. By doing so, they can contribute to the team's overall defensive strategy and help minimize the chances of a goal being scored against them.

Overall, this analysis provides important information for improving the Sabres' defense and enhancing their chances of success. However, it should be noted that the moderate correlation between xRebound and xGoal indicates that rebounds are just one of several factors that contribute to goal scoring. Nonetheless, by addressing the team's weaknesses in defending against rebounds, they can help minimize their opponents' chances of scoring, which could have a significant impact on their overall performance.
